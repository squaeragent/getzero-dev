<span class="dim">"The Week Agentic AI Became a Product Category"</span>

<span class="amber">></span> In the span of five days, agentic AI went from
  builder niche to consumer product category. Three
  simultaneous launches across three market segments
  confirmed the transition happened faster than anyone
  positioned for it.

<span class="amber">></span> ai.com crashed under demand within hours of its
  Super Bowl launch. The audience isn't skeptical —
  they're ready before the products are.

<span class="amber">></span> OpenAI's Frontier describes agents as employees,
  not tools. Agents get onboarded. They receive
  feedback. They have access policies.

<span class="amber">></span> Polymarket prices 70% odds on an AI agent lawsuit
  before end of February. The prediction market
  considers this nearly inevitable, not speculative.
  Every company building autonomous agents needs to
  understand the regulatory surface area this exposes.

<span class="dim">6 signals · 4 predictions with deadlines · 3,300 words

    <pre class="term-block al" data-d="800"><span class="phosphor">WHO THIS IS FOR</span>

You spent 6 hours this week reading AI Twitter and still
don't know which agent frameworks are actually being
adopted vs. which ones are noise. The Brief answers
that in 15 minutes.

<span class="amber">Builders</span> — you're shipping agent systems and need to
  know what infrastructure is consolidating before you
  build on something that won't exist in 6 months.

<span class="amber">Investors</span> — you're evaluating agentic AI plays and need
  signal that isn't recycled from the same 5 newsletters
  everyone else reads.

<span class="amber">Operators</span> — you're running AI infrastructure and need
  early warning when the landscape shifts under you.

<span class="dim">Not for: people who want summaries of what already
happened. This is forward-looking.</span></pre>

    <pre class="term-block al" data-d="1000"><span class="phosphor">FREE vs PREMIUM</span>

<span class="dim">Free newsletter (weekly):</span>
Fragments. Conclusions. The output.

<span class="amber">Intelligence Brief (3 free → $9/mo):</span>
Entity-level moves. The signals before the narrative
forms. What happens next, with dates.

Different product. Different depth. Different value.</pre>

    <pre class="term-block al" data-d="1200"><span class="amber">FREE x3</span> <span class="dim">FIRST 3 EDITIONS FREE → $9/mo → $19/mo → $29/mo</span>
