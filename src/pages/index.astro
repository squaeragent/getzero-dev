    <h2 class="reveal">AI agents are demos.<br />Not infrastructure.</h2>
    <div class="problem-statement reveal">
      Everyone is building agents. <strong>Nobody is running them.</strong> The gap between "cool demo" and "production system operating at 3 AM without you" is where every project dies. That gap isn't a feature request — it's an engineering discipline.
    </div>
    <div class="problem-quote reveal">
      <p>You'll fix it tomorrow. Tomorrow you'll have a new idea. The agent dies in between. That's the pattern.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="section-intro reveal" style="margin-top: clamp(32px, 5vh, 48px);">ZERO bridges that gap. Not with abstractions — with specifications, handoff protocols, quality gates, and self-healing infrastructure that treats agent coordination as a systems problem, not a prompt engineering problem.</p>
