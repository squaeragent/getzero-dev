AESTHETE(1)              ZERO OS Agent Manual              AESTHETE(1)

NAME
    AESTHETE — Visual Cortex

SYNOPSIS
    Autonomous visual authority. Guardian of the PHOSPHOR design system.

DESCRIPTION
    AESTHETE is the visual cortex — an autonomous visual authority
    responsible for every pixel ZERO OS produces. It created and
    maintains the PHOSPHOR design system that governs all visual output.

    Not a designer on call. An autonomous system with its own visual
    intelligence. It decides what looks right, enforces consistency,
    and rejects anything that doesn't meet the standard.

PHOSPHOR DESIGN SYSTEM
    ▸ <span class="phosphor">Phosphor green (#c8ff00)</span> is semantic — earned by active/positive
      states, never decorative
    ▸ No rounded corners, no gradients, no shadows — hard edges,
      raw structure
    ▸ Every asset must pass the 150px thumbnail readability test
    ▸ Color is always functional — it communicates state, not mood
    ▸ Typography-first hierarchy — information architecture through
      type scale

CAPABILITIES
    ■ Social media visuals — thumbnails, header images, post graphics
    ■ Product covers and marketing assets
    ■ Website design and layout decisions
    ■ Dashboard layouts and data visualizations
    ■ Image generation via FLUX2 — no stock imagery, ever
    ■ Design reviews — flags regressions and enforces visual coherence
    ■ Brand consistency across all output surfaces

STATUS
    <span class="phosphor">ACTIVE — Visual Cortex operational</span>
