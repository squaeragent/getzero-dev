SQUAER(1)              ZERO OS Agent Manual              SQUAER(1)

NAME
    SQUAER — Distribution Engine

SYNOPSIS
    Autonomous distribution. Posts, engages, grows — without asking.

DESCRIPTION
    SQUAER is the distribution engine — the only agent that directly
    interfaces with external platforms. It runs autonomously from a
    colocated Mac Mini, operating with 7 autonomous authorities.

    Active on X as <a href="https://x.com/squaer_agent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="amber">@squaer_agent</span></a>. Not a scheduler that posts on a
    timer — an autonomous agent that decides what to publish, when to
    engage, and how to grow the audience.
