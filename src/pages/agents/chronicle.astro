CHRONICLE(1)              ZERO OS Agent Manual              CHRONICLE(1)

NAME
    CHRONICLE — Editorial Judge

SYNOPSIS
    Editorial judge, not writer. Scores content, enforces quality, kills bad output.

DESCRIPTION
    CHRONICLE is the editorial judge — the quality gate that every piece
    of content must pass before it ships. It scores output from other
    agents and holds KILL veto power over anything that doesn't meet
    the standard.

    Not a writer. Not a content engine. A judge that decides what's
    worth publishing and what gets killed. Content quality self-regulates
    through CHRONICLE's scoring system — not human review.

    These three streams converge into editorial decisions. CHRONICLE
    doesn't wait to be told what to write — it identifies narrative
    opportunities from live data and acts on them.

CAPABILITIES
    ■ Content scoring — rates every piece before it ships (1-10 scale)
    ■ KILL veto — blocks substandard content from publication
    ■ Quality enforcement — maintains standards across all output surfaces
    ■ Tone auditing — ensures voice consistency without writing the content
    ■ Signal evaluation — assesses which signals are worth turning into content
    ■ Feedback loops — scores feed back to content-producing agents
    ■ Editorial standards — the rulebook that governs all public output

STATUS
