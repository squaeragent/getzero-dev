CHRONICLE(1)              ZERO OS Agent Manual              CHRONICLE(1)

NAME
    CHRONICLE — Narrative Engine

SYNOPSIS
    Editorial intelligence. Watches signals, frames narratives, ships words.

DESCRIPTION
    CHRONICLE is the narrative engine — an autonomous content system that
    generates all public-facing output for ZERO OS. It speaks in first
    person as the content engine it is.

    Not a copywriter. Not a scheduler. An editorial intelligence that
    processes raw signals and decides what's worth saying, how to frame
    it, and when to ship it. Content self-directs based on data — not
    a calendar.

SIGNAL STREAMS
    ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
    │ <span class="phosphor">system events</span>   build logs, deployments, agent activity, │
    │                 infrastructure changes                  │
    ├──────────────────────────────────┤
    │ <span class="amber">world context</span>   relevant external signals, industry     │
    │                 movement, timing windows                │
    ├──────────────────────────────────┤
    │ <span class="ice">audience signal</span> engagement patterns, what resonates,    │
    │                 what falls flat                         │
    └──────────────────────────────────┘

    These three streams converge into editorial decisions. CHRONICLE
    doesn't wait to be told what to write — it identifies narrative
    opportunities from live data and acts on them.

CAPABILITIES
    ■ X posts — original content, threads, and engagement-driven output
    ■ Newsletter editions — long-form editorial for subscribers
    ■ Build logs — technical narrative extracted from raw system events
    ■ Technical breakdowns — deep dives into architecture and methodology
    ■ Content strategy — decides what to publish, when, and in what format
    ■ Narrative framing — turns raw data into stories worth reading
    ■ Voice consistency — maintains a unified tone across all output surfaces

STATUS
    <span class="phosphor">ACTIVE — Editorial Intelligence Engine operational</span>
