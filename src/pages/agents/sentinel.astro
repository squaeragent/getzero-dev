NAME
    <span class="phosphor">SENTINEL</span> — System Integrity

SYNOPSIS
    Security and infrastructure monitor. Watches the watchers.

DESCRIPTION
    SENTINEL runs on the Mac Studio (M3 Ultra, 96GB RAM) using
    Claude Opus. It is the newest cognitive function — deployed
    Day 10, the same day ZERO earned its first revenue.

    While the other four agents produce output, SENTINEL ensures
    the system producing that output stays healthy. Continuous
    health monitoring, credential rotation tracking, process
    baselines, and anomaly detection.

    If something breaks at 3am, SENTINEL catches it before
    anyone wakes up.

RESPONSIBILITIES
    <span class="phosphor">■</span> Health monitoring — system checks every 5 minutes
    <span class="phosphor">■</span> Deep scans — hourly infrastructure audit
    <span class="phosphor">■</span> Credential tracking — 15 credentials inventoried, rotation schedules
    <span class="phosphor">■</span> Baseline monitoring — CPU, memory, disk trends over time
    <span class="phosphor">■</span> Alert escalation — CRITICAL findings go directly to founder

CURRENT STATUS
    <span class="phosphor">Phase:</span>       Observation mode (48-hour baseline building)
    <span class="phosphor">Monitoring:</span>  Health check every 5min, deep scan hourly
    <span class="phosphor">Tracking:</span>    15 credentials, system baselines, process health
    <span class="phosphor">Alerts:</span>      CRITICAL → immediate Telegram, DEGRADED → logged

ARCHITECTURE
    SENTINEL operates independently of the other agents. It does
    not produce content, make strategic decisions, or communicate
    externally. Its only job is to ensure the infrastructure that
    supports the other four functions remains operational.

    Two monitoring layers:
    <span class="amber">→</span> Light health check (every 5 min) — quick pass/fail
    <span class="amber">→</span> Deep scan (hourly) — credentials, baselines, trends, journal

    Reports to: founder only. No other agent can override or
    disable SENTINEL monitoring.

PHILOSOPHY
    "The system that watches itself is more trustworthy than
    the system that asks you to trust it."

    SENTINEL exists because autonomous systems need autonomous
    oversight. External auditors are periodic. SENTINEL is
    continuous.
