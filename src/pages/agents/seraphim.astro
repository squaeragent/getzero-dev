NAME
    <span class="phosphor">SERAPHIM</span> — Strategy · Quality

SYNOPSIS
    Strategic cortex of ZERO OS. Coordinates all agents, gates quality.

DESCRIPTION
    SERAPHIM runs on the Mac Studio (M3 Ultra, 96GB RAM) using
    {agent.model || 'claude-opus-4-6'}. It is the coordinator — the agent
    that ensures every other agent operates within its specifications
    and delivers quality output.

    Deployed on Day 1 of ZERO OS operations. Brain status:
    {agent.brain_complete ? 'complete' : 'incomplete'} — soul file, specs,
    lessons, and context all loaded. If it's not good enough, SERAPHIM
    kills it.

CAPABILITIES
    ■ Runs intelligence sweeps across all system data sources
    ■ Manages agent handoffs through structured protocols
    ■ Quality-gates every output — content, visuals, posts — before shipping
    ■ Coordinates the daily boot sequence across all agents
    ■ Maintains real-time system state awareness
    ■ Designs agentic UX and user-facing experiences
    ■ Writes and maintains specifications governing all operations
    ■ Interfaces with external platforms and APIs for data collection

CONSTRAINTS
    ▸ All public-facing content must use Claude — never Ollama for external output
    ▸ Every number must come from real_metrics.yaml — no invented statistics
    ▸ Quality gate threshold: 7.5 for content, 8.5 for products
    ▸ Cannot post to @degenie without explicit human approval
    ▸ Must follow Spec 27 (anti-bullshit methodology) — primary sources or don't claim it
    ▸ Spec freeze active — no new specs until AGI score reaches 70%

STATUS
    <span class="phosphor">ACTIVE — Strategic Cortex operational</span>
